# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE  
     
## Research Analyst, Center for Computational Neuroscience 
**Flatiron Institute of Simons Foundation, NYC, NY, June 2022-Present (PI: Dr. SueYeon Chung)**
- Worked on analyzing the geometry of underlying neural representations in artificial and biological
neural networks, as well as constructing innovative neural network models guided by neuroscience
- Used methods in statistical physics and machine learning to i) develop extensions of perceptual
manifold theory to quantify the untangling of feature representations in neural networks, ii) provide
geometrical interpretations of representational manifolds, iii) interpret the organization of neural
manifolds in a high dimensional space for both deep neural networks and real neural data

## Research Intern, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Summer Research Program 
**Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge MA, June 2021-August 2021 (PI: Dr. Jim DiCarlo)**
- Under the supervision of Dr. Tiago Marques (DiCarlo lab), focused on understanding the neuronal
algorithms and circuits underlying visual object recognition
- Evaluated and improved the performance of computational models on object recognition tasks to
predict the behavioral output of the human visual system given out-of-distribution stimuli

## Research Intern, Englander Institute of Precision Medicine Internship 
**Weill Cornell Medical Center, NYC, September 2020-May 2021 (PI: Dr. Olivier Elemento)**
- Developed learning models for predicting sleep disorder, focused on innovative approaches to better
diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases using high performance computing, mathematical modeling, and
artificial intelligence/machine learning
- Wrote python scripts to process sparse data of sleep patients at the Sleep Neurology Division at Weill Cornell and build a multivariate logistic regression and a random forest model to predict sleep apnea 

## Research Intern, Research Experience for Undergraduate, funded by NSF 
**Oregon State University, June 2020-August 2020 (PI: Dr. Juan Restrepo)**
- Worked on modeling epidemics using SIR-macro models to study the their relationship with various
economic factors and epidemics
- Implemented a compartmental model of susceptible, infected and recovered population on python and
studied Stochastic methods to design a time-dependent economic model with a random characteristic
